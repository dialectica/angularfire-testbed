# angularfire-seed â€” the seed for Angular+Firebase apps + UI Router

This derivative of [angularfire-seed](https://github.com/firebase/angularFire-seed) is an application
skeleton for a typical [AngularFire](http://angularfire.com/) web app. You can use it to quickly
bootstrap your Angular + Firebase projects.

This version of angularfire-seed replaces the ngRoute with Angular's [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router).

Considerations:
* Unit testing is needed.
* You will need to add ui-router to bower. Currently uses CDN.
* Feedback welcome.
